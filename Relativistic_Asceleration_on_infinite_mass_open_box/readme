# `TwotypeColision.m`

This MATLAB function simulates the **Ultra-relativistic energy evolution of a particles (Type 1)** interacting with a background medium (Type 2) via elastic collisions. It models how the beam energy distribution changes over time due to random scattering off background particles with fixed velocity magnitude but randomized direction.

  	•	ic.beta2 — Magnitude of background particle velocity (in units of c)
	•	edges — Struct for histogram binning:
	  •	  edges.type1 — Logarithmic bin edges for the energy histogram
	•	time_s — Struct with simulation time configuration:
	  •	  time_s.stepinc — Time interval between histogram snapshots
